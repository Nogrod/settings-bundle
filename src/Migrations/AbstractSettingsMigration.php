 * Extend this class for easier migration implementation.

 * the SettingsMigrationInterface directly.
 *
 * The class tries to call the method migrateToVersionN($data, $metadata) for each version step, where N is the version
 * number. If the method does not exist, an exception is thrown. You can override the resolveStepHandler() method to
 * change this behavior.
